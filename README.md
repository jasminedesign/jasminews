# Jasmine Web Starter (JasmineWS)

## Overview of JasmineWS

> Using only your Browser and a free GitHub account make and publish a website.

We have wanted to show how to build a website, along with an introduction into version control using Git and GitHub for a while. But without having to cover how to set everything up on your machine so you have the tools to be able to follow along on Windows, MacOS or Chromebook.

I think now that most of these barriers have gone away with the modern tooling allowing you to get started on your project with version control and to see the results of your build published on a URL all from your own ***Web Browser***.

With the launch of GitHub Web Editor (github.dev editor) came a lower barrier to getting started with the introduction to working in the browser. Simplifying the process of making changes to your files and starting to work with GIT for version control on GitHub from your browser using Windows, MacOS and Chromebook.

Before this we would have had to cover installing software on your machine and the setup steps needed. This all changed thanks to the great workflow offered now in the browser with the release of Visual Studio Code for the web (github.dev & vscode.dev)

Our tutorials are written with a ***Small Business Owner*** or ***student*** in mind who have an interest or some knowledge of the web, but we also hope that they are a great starting place for anyone wanting to learn how to build a website for free.

The Git repository is an ideal home for the project as it offers version control, a back up and you can deploy from it as well. GitHub also offers many more great features to support your project.

Which is why we think it's a great skill to learn whether you are just starting out building things or wanting to grow your knowledge base with something new.

## JasmineWS Templates

![JasmineWS Templates](https://jasminews.uk/github/jwsone.svg)

We have released released two JWS templates a [One](https://github.com/jasminedesign/jwsone "github.com/jasminedesign/jwsone") and [Two](https://github.com/jasminedesign/jwstwo "github.com/jasminedesign/jwstwo") column design.

The idea of the templates is you can make changes to the content within the HTML File and it is styled for you using the CSS provided.

All of this is covered within a tutorial that provides [step by step guide](https://Jasminews.uk/docs/ "jasminews.uk/docs")  of the tasks and then provides the steps need to publish/deploy this to a hosting account.

> Fun fact: The JasmineWS website is made using the CSS file from the templates as its core to which we have added classes to support the features/design that we needed.
