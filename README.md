# Jasmine Web Starter (JasmineWS)

## Overview of JasmineWS

> Using only your Browser and a free GitHub account make and publish a website.

We have wanted to show how to build a website, along with an introduction into version control using Git and GitHub but without having to cover how to set everything up on your machine so you can follow along on Windows, MacOS and Chromebook.

I think now that most of these barriers have gone away with the modern tooling allowing you to get started on your project with version control and to see the results of your build published on a URL all from your own ***Web Browser***.

Our tutorials are written with a ***Small Business Owner*** in mind that has an interest or some web knowledge to start with in the web, but I hope also that they are great for anyone that wants to get started building a website.

For more information on the JasmineWS project please take a look at our [website](https://Jasminews.uk "jasminews.uk") and to see what we have planned next take a look at our [roadmap](https://Jasminews.uk/roadmap "jasminews.uk/roadmap").

## JasmineWS Templates

![JasmineWS Templates](https://jasminews.uk/github/jwsone.svg)

We have released released two starter templates a One and Two column design.

The idea of the templates is you can make changes to the content within the HTML File and it is styled for you using the CSS provided.

All of this is covered within a tutorial that provides step by step guide of the tasks and then provides the steps need to publish/deploy this to a hosting account.

> Fun fact: The JasmineWS website is made using the CSS file from the templates as its core to which we have added classes to support the features/design that we needed.
